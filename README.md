## Intro: Object Orientation Project Week

Welcome back!

Last week you spent time diving in to object oriented programming in ruby. This week you'll have the opportunity to take your learning further by working in groups to build out interesting real-life models. By the end of this week, you should have a better grasp of object orientation and will have the back-end skills to work on your final project.
